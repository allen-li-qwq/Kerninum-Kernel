# The Kerninum Kernel
###### A simple OS for all to use
Kerninum is a simple micro-kernel inspired by the seL4 project and I am going to build a secure, fast and open operating system.

My final goal is to make it a general-purpose OS, which runs on desktop, server, and even embedded platfrom.
## The current status
It is just getting started, but I believe that will come true one day.
## Other information
I will be very thankful if you want to join me. But considering I don't have a lot of time to finish this project (unlike Linus), so I don't really need partners.
